"""
``keybinder`` is a python module for registering global key bindings,
for gtk-based applications.

This module originates in `Tomboy`_ and has been widely reused without
having a separate release. This package has taken the python module
for Tomboy's keybinder from the `Deskbar Applet`_ project, and broken
it out to a standalone module.

The module is licenced under the GNU General Public License v2 (or at
your option, any later version), see the included file COPYING for
details.
